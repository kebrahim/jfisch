<ul>
<li>
Same as Survivor, but you pick a team to LOSE each week and can NOT pick the same team twice all regular season. 
</li>
<li><strong>
Weeks 14-17, you will be making TWO picks, both picks must lose in order to advance to the next week.  
</strong></li>
<li>
Single-elimination, if your pick wins or ties, you are ELIMINATED!
</li>
</ul>

<h5>TIEBREAKERS</h5>
<ul>
<li>
If the last two or more entrants all pick incorrect in the same week (but not the final week of the regular season), then they will continue to make picks the following week. The exception to this is if in Weeks 14 thru 17, if for example, three entrants are left, and one entrant picks one out of two incorrect and the other two entrants pick both incorrect, the entrant who picked one out of two would win and then other two entrants would continue playing the following week for second place.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>ANTI-DEFAULT PICKS</h5>
<ul>
<li>
There will be NO DEFAULT PICKS this year.  If you fail to make your pick, you are automatically ELIMINATED â€“ zero exceptions to this rule!!!
